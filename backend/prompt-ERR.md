# Sesión de chat con Cursor, gpt-4o como LLM




### Prompt
You are an experienced systems architect and SQL DB admin. Analyze the existing DB schema defined with Prisma in @schema.prisma and see how we could amend the Prisma definition to include the entities and relations defined in Mermaid format in @evolution_mermaid.txt . Do no write any code yet. Ask any questions you may have.

Additionally, take into account that we want the new version of the schema to be in "Boyce–Codd normal form" (also known as 3.5NF or BCNF)



### Prompt
Ok, please find the answers to your questions:
- 1: For salary_min and salary_max, we can use Int. For score, we rather use Float. For text fields, let's give a max lenght of 500 chars.
- 2: Optional fields: Let's assume all the fields are required.
- 3: Let's assume that. 
- 4: Indexing and Performance: we will come to this in a further step, let's focus on having the schema complying to BCNF.
- 5: As the application is still in demo phase, we do not need to worry about existing data. Consider there is no previous data.
- 6: Just the normal requirements for any schema to remain BCNF.

### Prompt
Yes, please proceed with the changes

No me quedaba muy claro el significado de la relación entre "position" y "interview_flow", así que he decidido explorar como el asistente me podía ayudar a entender esta parte.

### Prompt
Can you explain what do you understand is the relation between position and interviewFlow?

### Answer
In the provided Mermaid diagram, the relationship between POSITION and INTERVIEW_FLOW is depicted as:
POSITION ||--|| INTERVIEW_FLOW : assigns

This indicates a one-to-one relationship between POSITION and INTERVIEW_FLOW. Each POSITION is assigned exactly one INTERVIEW_FLOW, and each INTERVIEW_FLOW is assigned to exactly one POSITION.
In the Prisma schema, this relationship is represented as follows:
....

}
In this schema:
The Position model has a foreign key interviewFlowId that references the InterviewFlow model.
The InterviewFlow model has a list of positions to represent the inverse relationship.
However, to strictly enforce a one-to-one relationship in Prisma, we should ensure that each InterviewFlow is associated with only one Position. This can be done by removing the list of positions from InterviewFlow and ensuring the interviewFlowId in Position is unique.
Here is the corrected schema to enforce the one-to-one relationship:
....

assigns
This indicates a one-to-one relationship between POSITION and INTERVIEW_FLOW. Each POSITION is assigned exactly one INTERVIEW_FLOW, and each INTERVIEW_FLOW is assigned to exactly one POSITION.
In the Prisma schema, this relationship is represented as follows:
}
In this schema:
The Position model has a foreign key interviewFlowId that references the InterviewFlow model.
The InterviewFlow model has a list of positions to represent the inverse relationship.
However, to strictly enforce a one-to-one relationship in Prisma, we should ensure that each InterviewFlow is associated with only one Position. This can be done by removing the list of positions from InterviewFlow and ensuring the interviewFlowId in Position is unique.
Here is the corrected schema to enforce the one-to-one relationship:
 
In this corrected schema:
The interviewFlowId field in the Position model is marked as @unique, ensuring that each InterviewFlow is associated with only one Position.
The InterviewFlow model no longer has a list of positions, reflecting the one-to-one relationship.

 En realidad, el asistente se ha dado cuenta de que algo no casaba y, no sólo me ha explicado la relación, sino que me ha propuesto una corrección a una anomalía que él mismo ha detectado al modelo de datos

 Now, using your skills as experienced DBA, update the Prisma schema @schema.prisma with the recommended indexes that the database should contain, so the application remains with decent performance and a good balance between read/list endpoints and write ones, thus not overcreating unnecessary indexes
